# Thinking about Japan

I read the guidebook about Japan. I think the place I'd like to go to most in Japan is Tokyo. I think that I'm most looking forward to the food. I love sushi! I also like bento boxes, too, but mostly sushi. Sushi, sushi, sushi! 

Besides the food, I like Japanese art. They are colorful and bright, gorgeous costumes in plays with sword fights, tearful reunions, and acrobatics. I would also like to see the Imperial Palace in Tokyo.
