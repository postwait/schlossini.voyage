# Where I Want to Visit

 I thought that Barcelona was a very memorable experience, and I want to go back. The streets of Barcelona are basically like a mall. There are no doors on the shops or restaurants, so you can walk right in. Barcelona has that "I want to stay" factor.
 
 Another place I want to go is Venice, Italy. The streets are canals, and the architecture is so amazing. The land and houses look like they are floating on water. 
 
 The last place that I *really* want to go is Vienna, Austria. The cathedrals, and architecture is truly amazing. I am very excited about this trip, and I am very excited about travelling to foreign places.
