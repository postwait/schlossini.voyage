# I'm excited to travel

I'm most excited to visit Peru. When I did my research, I learned that
Peru has nice beaches, interesting architecture and fun mountain hiking.

I tend to get a bit car sick, air sick and everything sick.  I am a bit
worried that I will spend a lot of time sick.  My dad assures me that I
won't be any more sick on the road than at home. I hope he's right.

I like fruits a lot. I am interested in seeing new fruits (and veggies).
I'm also interested in how different people speak. I know English and I
am learning Italian, but I am very interested in all languages.
