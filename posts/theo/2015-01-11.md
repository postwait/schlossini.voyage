# Build a blog

I've spent some time writing some custom blogging software for our trip.
It is important that our whole family be able to share their experiences
with loved ones at home and do so in a way that allow us to recreate our
journey over time.  Once we return, we'd like to to be able to review our
progress day-by-day and understand how things really were as we were
writing down our experiences.

This blog leverages [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and
[express](http://expressjs.com/).  It's fairly simple and does not include
publisher tools.  I want to teach my family how to use source control and
how to edit raw document sources, so I'll be having the bunch post their
experiences by committing and pushing markdown to github; hopefully this
doesn't backfire.

I imagine that the underlying software will be a work-in-progress until
the day we stop publishing.
