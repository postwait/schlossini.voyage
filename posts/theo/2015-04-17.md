# Planning: Insurance

It turns out that a lot can go wrong while traveling.  It also turns out
that a lot can go wrong while driving or living or working.  While
everyone needs insurance of one type or another, it turns out we need
very little of what we did have and a lot of what we didn't.

We are very lucky to have USAA as an insurer, and while they have a wide
array of insurance options, we thought a travel centric insurance plan
would make more sense.  We chose [World Nomads](http://worldnomads.com/)
for insurance during our around the world trip.  Something we didn't
think about before is that most of these policies will only include
directly related family members (blood relatives).  As our nanny is
coming with us, we needed to get two plans: one for the five
of us and one for her.  To make thing sane we got both plans with all
the same options so the only think we need to remember separately are
the policy numbers.

While we're maintaining our health insurance at home, we need to drop
all of our auto-insurance as we sell our cars and switch our home-owners
policy to be one that is appropriate for renting to tenants.
